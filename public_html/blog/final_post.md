#Final post

This was a different course with very free hands due to the no lecture and only some notes
what you should do in a couple of weeks. Usually you have a few lectures that you should attend to
and assignments with strict deadlines. 

If you can keep up the motivation and working pace this method is good. It is more important when you don't
have strict deadlines.
My own motivation was good in the beginning and middle but when we got close to the holiday it got quite bad.

I think it is good with individual meetings there you can talk about specific things.
I have learned more about web developement and that there is more ways than just standard html, css and javascript
that you can do. Node.js is an interesting and different way of doing a web page.

My goal was to become better at Javascript and in a way I did. I got a wider knowledge of what you can do
with Javascript.
